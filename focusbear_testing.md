Issues Found in Focus Bear (Android) – First-Time User Testing
1. Accessibility permission turns off automatically
I enable Accessibility permission correctly.
But when I start Focus Mode, it turns off again automatically.
This makes Focus Mode not work properly and is confusing for new users.

2. Allowed apps list does not open during launcher setup
When setting up the launcher, I tried to select allowed apps
The list did not open at all.
I could not continue, and it made the onboarding feel stuck.

3. Blocked apps still open in Focus Mode
Even after enabling Focus Mode, some apps like WhatsApp or Instagram could still be opened.
This reduces the effectiveness of Focus Mode for beginners.

4. Focus Mode timer freezes
The focus timer sometimes stays at 0:00 and does not start.
I couldn’t understand whether the session actually began or not.

5. Onboarding flow is confusing
After granting a permission, the app does not automatically return me to the setup screen.
I had to switch apps manually to continue.
For a first-time user, this feels unclear.

6. Launcher setup sometimes crashes
During launcher setup, the app closed unexpectedly.
I had to reopen the app and restart the setup.
Improvement Ideas
Idea 1 — Make onboarding more guided
After each permission is granted, the app should automatically bring the user back.
This will reduce confusion and make onboarding smoother.

Idea 2 — Add a "Test Setup" button
A button that checks if all permissions (Accessibility, Launcher, Notifications, Battery) are active.
This helps users confirm everything is working.
