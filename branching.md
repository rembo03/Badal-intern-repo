1. Why is pushing directly to main problematic?
Mistakes go straight into the real project.
It can break the code for everyone.
No one reviews your changes before they go live.
If many people push to main, it becomes messy and hard to track.
Bugs can enter the project without anyone noticing.

2. How do branches help with reviewing code?
You can work on your own branch safely.
Your code can be checked and reviewed before merging.
Other developers can comment, request changes, and improve quality.
Only clean and tested code gets added to main.

3. What happens if two people edit the same file on different branches?
Git will show a merge conflict.
Git asks the team to decide which version is correct.
The team manually fixes the conflict and then merges the branch.
This prevents accidental overwriting of someone else's work.

4. Why teams use branches (super simple summary)
To avoid breaking main
To review code properly
To test features safely
To work in parallel without clashing
To organise work better
