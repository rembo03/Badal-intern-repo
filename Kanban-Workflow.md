# Agile Workflows & Kanban – Badal Moreya

## 1. Research & Learn

**Q:** How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?  
**A:** A Kanban board visualizes all tasks and their progress. It helps the team see what is pending, in progress, blocked, or done. This makes workflow transparent and easier to manage.

**Q:** What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?  
**A:**  
- **Backlog:** Tasks that need to be done but haven’t started yet.  
- **In Progress:** Tasks currently being worked on.  
- **Blocked:** Tasks that cannot move forward due to some dependency or issue.  
- **Done / Completed:** Finished tasks that are verified and completed.

**Q:** How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?  
**A:** Tasks move from Backlog → In Progress → Blocked (if needed) → Done/Completed. Each team member is responsible for updating their own tasks, while the team lead or PM can monitor the overall board.

**Q:** What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?  
**A:** Limiting WIP ensures focus, reduces multitasking, avoids bottlenecks, and helps the team finish tasks faster with better quality.

## 2. Reflection

**Q:** How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?  
**A:** By visualizing all tasks and limiting WIP, Kanban makes it easy to focus on the most important tasks first and prevents taking on too many tasks at once.

**Q:** How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?  
**A:** I can prioritize my testing tasks, update task statuses consistently, and ensure blockers are reported immediately to avoid delays. Using Kanban helps me plan my day better and track progress clearly.

## 3. Task Implementation

**Q:** Check out Focus Bear’s Kanban board and note how tasks are structured.  
**A:** Tasks are structured with columns for Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, and Done/Completed. Each task shows a title, description, and assigned person.

**Q:** Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.  
**A:** I moved a testing task “Verify login functionality” from **Backlog → In Progress → Done / Completed**. Updated the task status and added a comment about test results.

**Q:** Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.  
**A:** I can add detailed comments on each testing task with steps taken, screenshots, or issues found. This helps developers understand the status better and improves overall team communication.

> Personal Note: Moving a task through the board from Backlog to Completed made me realize how useful Kanban is for staying organized. I could quickly see which tasks need attention and track my progress efficiently.
