# Agile at Focus Bear – Badal Moreya

## 1. Agile Principles & Frameworks

**Q:** What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?  
**A:** Agile is a flexible, iterative approach to project management that focuses on delivering small, incremental improvements. Unlike traditional project management (Waterfall), Agile emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, and continuous feedback rather than following a fixed plan from start to finish.

**Q:** What are the core values and principles of Agile?  
**A:**  
- **Core Values (Agile Manifesto):**  
  1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
  2. Working software over comprehensive documentation  
  3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
  4. Responding to change over following a plan  

- **Principles include:**  
  - Deliver working solutions frequently  
  - Welcome changing requirements  
  - Close collaboration between business and development teams  
  - Maintain sustainable pace of work  
  - Continuous improvement through reflection  

**Q:** What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?  
**A:**  
- **Scrum:** Time-boxed iterations called sprints, defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), fixed sprint planning. Used when projects benefit from structured iterations and ceremonies.  
- **Kanban:** Continuous workflow, no fixed time-boxed sprints, focuses on visualizing work and limiting work in progress. Used when work is ongoing and priorities may change frequently.  

**Q:** Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?  
**A:** Kanban allows continuous delivery of tasks and better accommodates changing priorities, making it suitable for a fast-moving environment like Focus Bear. It provides visual workflow tracking and flexibility without strict sprint cycles.

## 2. Reflection

**Q:** What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?  
**A:**  
- **Benefits:** Faster delivery, flexibility to adapt to changes, better team collaboration, continuous feedback.  
- **Challenges:** Requires discipline in communication, regular updates, and can be confusing for teams unfamiliar with Agile practices.  

**Q:** How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?  
**A:** Agile encourages clear communication, adaptability, and incremental progress, which helps me stay organized, deliver work efficiently, and adjust quickly to changing priorities.

## 3. Task Implementation

**Q:** Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.  
**A:** Scrum works in fixed-length sprints with defined roles and ceremonies, suitable for projects needing structured iterations. Kanban is continuous, flexible, and visualizes workflow, ideal for ongoing tasks with changing priorities.

**Q:** Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.  
**A:** “Responding to change over following a plan” will be most useful, as it helps me adapt quickly to new tasks or priorities during the internship.
