## 1. Key Roles in an Agile Team

**Q:** What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?

**Q:** How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?  
**A:**  
- **Scrum:** We plan tasks for each sprint and meet in daily stand-ups. Everyone knows what they have to do for the sprint.  
- **Kanban:** Work is more flexible. Tasks move on the board, and people take them when ready. Communication is ongoing.
