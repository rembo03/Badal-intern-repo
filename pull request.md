Pull Requests (PRs)
1. Why are PRs important in a team workflow?
They let team members check your code before it reaches the main branch.
They help catch mistakes early.
They improve code quality because teammates can comment and suggest fixes.
They keep the main branch stable and prevent breaking the whole project.
They create a clear record of what changed and why.

2. What makes a well-structured PR?
A good PR includes:
A clear title (example: “Fix login bug in user authentication”).
A short description explaining what changed and why.
Small, focused changes (not too big or confusing).
Issue links (example: Fixes #19).
Clean commit history without extra files.
Screenshots or GIFs if UI changes are included.
Notes on how to test the change.

3. What I learned from reviewing an open-source PR
(eg: reviewing React / Vue / Next.js PRs)
Developers explain their code clearly in comments.
Reviewers request changes respectfully.
Even experienced developers make mistakes and get feedback.
A PR may go through many revisions before approval.
Clear communication is important to avoid confusion.
The discussion helps everyone learn and improve.
