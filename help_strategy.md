1. When to use Google
When you see a common error message.
When you need examples or documentation.
When you don't understand how a library or function works.
When the problem is simple and not related to private company code.

2. When to use AI (like ChatGPT)
When you want a quick explanation in simple words.
When you want help understanding an error.
When Google results are confusing.
When you need ideas on how to fix or debug something.
When you want sample code or step‑by‑step guidance.
Avoid sharing private code or secrets.

3. When to ask a colleague
When the issue is urgent.
When it involves internal systems or setup.
When you already tried Google and AI but still stuck.
When you need a code review or pair programming.
After around 30 minutes with no progress.

4. Challenges developers face when troubleshooting alone
Getting stuck on the same idea.
Missing small mistakes.
Not understanding a complex system.
Losing time by searching in the wrong direction.
Feeling scared to ask for help.
Guessing instead of finding the real cause.

5. Simple step-by-step flow
Try to understand the error.
Try basic debugging.
Search Google.
Ask AI for help.
If still stuck → ask a colleague.
