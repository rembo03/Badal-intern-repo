Chrome Extensions for Developer Productivity
To improve my web development workflow, I installed several Chrome extensions that help with debugging, testing, and analyzing web applications.

🔌 Extensions I Installed & Why
1. React Developer Tools
Helps me inspect React components directly from the browser.

I can see component structure, props, and state.

Very useful when working on React apps.

2. Redux DevTools
Helps me track Redux state changes.

Shows actions, reducers, and how the state updates.

Useful for debugging global state logic.

3. JSON Viewer
Automatically formats JSON responses in a readable way.

Makes API debugging easier.

Useful when checking backend responses or REST APIs.

4. Lighthouse
Built-in performance auditing tool.

Shows scores for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.

Helps me understand how to optimize web pages.

⭐ What I Learned
React Developer Tools makes it much easier to understand how components work internally.

JSON Viewer saves a lot of time when checking API outputs.

Lighthouse reports give clear suggestions for improving website performance.

Browser extensions can significantly speed up debugging and development.

🚀 Summary
These Chrome extensions improved my productivity by helping me:

Inspect React apps

Debug Redux state

Read API JSON data easily

Analyze web performance

I will continue using these tools in my daily development workflow.
