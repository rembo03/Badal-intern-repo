AI Tools for Development — My Experience
✅ 1. AI Tools I Used
1. GitHub Copilot
A VS Code extension

Gives code suggestions while typing

Helps write functions faster

2. ChatGPT
I used it to ask coding questions

Helps with debugging and explanations

3. Claude AI
Good for checking long code

Gives clean and simple answers

✅ 2. What I Tried
a. Code generation
I asked AI to create small code examples like loops, functions, and API calls.
It saved time and gave good starting points.

b. Debugging
I tested AI by giving it a small error in code.
AI helped me find the mistake and explained the fix.

c. Learning new topics
I used AI to understand things like:

Git commands

async/await

recursion

The explanations were very easy to understand.

⭐ 3. What Worked Well
Copilot helped in writing code faster

ChatGPT explained topics clearly

Claude was useful for longer code analysis

⚠️ 4. What Didn’t Work Well
Sometimes AI gives code that needs fixing

Copilot can suggest wrong or outdated syntax

AI doesn’t always understand full project context

💡 5. When AI Is Most Useful
AI is most helpful for:
Getting quick code suggestions
Fixing small errors
Learning new concepts
Writing repeated code (boilerplate)
Speeding up daily work
AI is not good for:
Writing full projects
Replacing real testing
Deep logic-specific tasks
