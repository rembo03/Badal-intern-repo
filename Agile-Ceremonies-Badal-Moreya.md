# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration – Badal Moreya

## 1. Research & Learn

**Q:** What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?  
**A:**  
- **Daily Stand-ups:** Quick daily meetings where team members share what they did yesterday, what they plan for today, and any blockers. Keeps everyone aligned.  
- **Sprint Planning (Scrum) / Continuous Prioritization (Kanban):** Planning tasks for the sprint in Scrum or prioritizing work continuously in Kanban. Helps the team know what to focus on.  
- **Retrospectives:** Meetings to reflect on what went well, what didn’t, and what can be improved. Encourages continuous improvement.  
- **Backlog Refinement:** Reviewing and updating the backlog to ensure tasks are clear, prioritized, and ready for the team.

**Q:** How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?  
**A:** Teams use tools like Jira, Slack, or email to share updates, attach notes, and track progress. Kanban boards allow team members to see task status at any time. Written updates and recordings help when people can’t join meetings live.

## 2. Reflection

**Q:** How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?  
**A:** Daily stand-ups keep everyone updated, planning ensures priorities are clear, retrospectives encourage feedback and improvement, and backlog refinement prevents confusion about what’s next. These ceremonies make sure the team is on the same page and work flows smoothly.

**Q:** Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?  
**A:** Daily Stand-ups are most important for me as a QA intern because I can report any bugs, ask questions about features, and know what the Developers are working on. This helps me plan my testing efficiently.

## 3. Task Implementation

**Q:** Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.  
**A:** Observed that each team member gives a short update on their work, mentions any blockers, and asks for help if needed. Everyone stays concise to keep the meeting quick.

**Q:** Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.  
**A:** Learned that retrospectives focus on team improvements, celebrating successes, and identifying challenges. Noted that honest feedback and suggestions make a big difference.

**Q:** Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.  
**A:** I can provide more detailed bug reports during stand-ups or in shared tools, so Developers can fix issues faster and with less back-and-forth.
