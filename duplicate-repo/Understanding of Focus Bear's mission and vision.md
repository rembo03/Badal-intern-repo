My Personal Reflection on Focus Bear
I have ADHD and autism (ASD), which make life both challenging and interesting. When I was in school up to 10th grade, I was very thin, weighing only 42 kg, and not very active. I wasn’t good at sports and often got bullied by my friends. Despite this, I was very good at studies and always came first in all my subjects and exams. I also loved electronics and spent long hours building small projects like a remote control boat and even a drone, working alone and focused on my dream of becoming an engineer.

I came from a very low-income background, so it was difficult to buy things for myself, including food I liked. Even so, I stayed focused on my goals. During high school, I struggled with depression, anxiety, and asthma. My family worried about me, and there weren’t enough medicines available for asthma. To stay healthy, I started going to a government gym that cost only $4 per month, and over two years I improved my strength and breathing.

In college and later life, I continued to focus on studies and personal projects, maintaining a balance with social life, though I don’t go out much or have many friends. Recently, I started using Focus Bear, and it has been helping me a lot to stay focused and avoid distractions. Over time, I have learned to manage my challenges, stay focused on my goals, and keep improving myself every day.

I also read Jeremy’s book, and it resonated with me a lot. He shared his personal experiences of living with ADHD and autism, the struggles he faced with school, relationships, health, and life skills, and how he gradually learned to manage them. His story highlighted the importance of focusing on personal strengths, learning from experience, and finding practical strategies to improve life—lessons that I found very helpful and inspiring.
